Introduction: 
In the 90s Alternative rock reached the mainstream,emerging from the Madchester scene to produce dream pop, shoegazing, post rock and indie pop, which led to the commercial success of Britpop bands like Blur and Oasis; followed by a stream of
post-Britpop bands like Radiohead and The Verve.

List of my favourite albums: 

- Post. Bj√∂rk. 
Description. The music is excellent and symphonically charged, with some electronic passages, but Bjork's voice is one that you will either love or hate. Watch video.

- OK COMPUTER. RADIOHEAD
Progress is a bitch, but don't let the machines, or their masters, grind you down: That is the simple message encoded in the art-rock razzle-dazzle of OK Computer.
